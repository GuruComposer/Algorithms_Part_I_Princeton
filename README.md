# Introduction to Algorithms

Cousera online course, [Introduction to Algorithms][1], created by Princeton
University, taught by: _Kevin Wayne_, Senior Lecturer and _Robert Sedgewick_,
Professor.

This course covers  essential algorithms and data structures that every serious programmer needs
to understand. The emphasis in this course was placed on understanding the algorithm, and then
implementing it to solve a useful scientific problem. Part I covers
data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms, time-space complexity analysis, and proofs.
Specific topics included: Union-Find, Analysis, Stacks and Queues, Elementary Sorts, Merge Sort,
Quick Sort, Priority Queues, Symbol Tables, Balanced Search Trees, Geometric Applications of BSTs,
Hash Tables, and Symbol Table Applications.

This codebase only covers the Part I of the course. All assignments passed the correctness and
time-space-complexity tests.

Assignment | Name | Score
:--- | :--- | ---
Assignment 1 | Percolation | 97/100
Assignment 2 | Queues | 100/100
Assignment 3 | Collinear | 97/100
Assignment 4 | 8 Puzzle | 95/100
Assignment 5 | Kd-Trees | 84/100

Thank you for reviewing my algorithms.
